# Object-Oriented-Design-Coursera-UOA
Summery of my learnings and assignment solutions throughout the [Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design/home/info) 
.

### Learnings

1. Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) technique to analyze and design the object-oriented model for a problem.	
2. Object-oriented modeling principles and their purpose (e.g., abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, generalization).
3. Difference between association, aggregation, and composition dependencies.
4. Object-oriented models as Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.
5. Translate between UML class diagrams and equivalent Java code.
6. Apply design guidelines for modularity, separation of concerns, information hiding, and conceptual integrity to create a flexible, reusable, maintainable design.
7. Cohesion and coupling.

### Assignments

3. Update the [SharingApp](https://github.com/Phylake1337/Object-Oriented-Design-Coursera-UOA/tree/main/SharingApp) to implement a new functionality using the updated UML class diagram as a guide.
- Add 3 new classes to add a contact feature to the app
